We were going to add batteries to the project last, just to see if the whole thing works as of now.

If by PCB you mean the code then we would probably waste until were done.

Our progress is kinda good, we have all the layers done and we just need to solder them.

We really should have worked on the cube when the project was truly started but instead we waited for the guide to be printed and worked on the code instead.
