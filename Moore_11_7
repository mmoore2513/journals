We accomplished almost everything but we required a lot of solder and it was a bit too much. We didn't finish by November 4th because we figured we could solder a layer a day but it didn't work out like that. The only thing that we really messed up with was waiting a week to print out the paper and instead we edited the code which took up a lot of time.
