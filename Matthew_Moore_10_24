On thursday and friday, we sorted through our stuff and did some math to see what colors we would have on each layer of the cube. Friday we edited the code from the versio we got off the website.

Today we hope to edit the code more and look at 4x4x4 code generators to see what we should do for our project

Tomorrow we hope to start making the cube since the paper we currently have is too small to push the leds through while keeping the angle we need for the cathode to be.

We hope to be done with the cube by friday or next week
